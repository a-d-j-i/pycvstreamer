pycvstreamer
============

A python web server that streams video using opencv.

The idea is to build a small, and simple server that can handle a 
few connection. Not intended for high troughput. The key is to be able 
to experiment with image/video processing while showing some results in the 
browser.
The idea is to have someting like motion ( http://motion.sourceforge.net/ ) and 
mjpg-streamer ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/ ) but leaving
some space to plug quickly different opencv/web routines and experiments.
